# Invoice-Data-Extraction-using-Azure-Document-Intelligence

1. This project demonstrates how to leverage Azure Blob Storage and Azure Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer) to automate the extraction of data from invoices. By uploading invoice images to Azure Blob Storage, the application uses Azure Document Intelligence to process and extract structured data such as invoice number, date, total amount, and itemized details.
2. The core of the solution revolves around Azureâ€™s powerful cloud services, which offer a scalable, reliable, and efficient solution for automating document processing tasks like invoice extraction.
